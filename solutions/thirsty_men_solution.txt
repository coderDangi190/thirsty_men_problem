Hereâ€™s how the situation plays out with smart guests:

## The Rule of the Game:=
        Only the first and last cups in a row get filled with water. The middle cup stays empty. 
        Guests need to place their cups in these positions to drink.

## The Challenge:=

->  Everyone wants water, but only two people can drink in each round.
->  If guests fight for the spots or cheat, no one gets water.

## The Smart Strategy:=

** The guests agree to take turns for fairness:-
        In the next round, they rotate positions, so everyone gets a chance to drink over time.
        In Round 1, Guest 1 takes the first spot, Guest 2 takes the last spot, and Guest 3 takes the middle (empty) spot.

## How It Works:=

** After every round, the guests swap positions:-
        The guest who had the first spot moves to the last spot.
        The one at the last spot takes the middle (empty) position.
        The one in the middle moves to the first spot.

** Example with 4 Guests:-
        Round 1: Guest 1 (First), Guest 2 (Last), Guest 3 (Middle), Guest 4 waits.
        Round 2: Guest 2 (First), Guest 3 (Last), Guest 4 (Middle), Guest 1 waits.
        Round 3: Guest 3 (First), Guest 4 (Last), Guest 1 (Middle), Guest 2 waits.

** Why This Works:-
        Everyone gets a fair chance over multiple rounds.
        Guests avoid deadlocks by cooperating instead of fighting for spots.

**If Someone Cheats:-
        The group agrees to skip their turn next round, ensuring fairness through peer pressure.

    Hence, This way everyone drinks without chaos!
